# Abstract

# Introduction

-   There is a growing need/demand for indicators for biodiversity, species abundance and demographic rates (see e.g. EBVs)

-   On one hand, these indicators need to be representative at large scales

-   This for e.g. international reporting towards biodiversity targets

-   On the other hand, indicators with decent spatial resolution are also needed

-   The reason for that is that that is the relevant scale for local-level managements and planning

-   This goes both for development decisions and species management and conservation (which typically happen at a county or even municipality level)

-   Besides organisational scale, there is also spatial variation not only in biodiversity, but also in population dynamics and life history of (target) species

-   This variation needs to be accounted for to develop successful and sustainable (harvest) management and conservation strategies

-   There is clear need for large-scale and spatially explicit indicators, but their development hinges on the availability of data from large-scale and long-term monitoring programmes

-   Several countries (in Europe) have been working towards setting up such programmes and been successful particularly for monitoring of some species groups, i.e. breeding birds and butterflies

-   Unfortunately, most of these monitoring programmes te limited to presence-absence or very simple count observations, making them suitable for the development of indicators of distribution and population trends, but usually not for indicators of abundance, population dynamics, and demographic rates

-   The primary reason here is that large-scale long-term monitoring programmes are very costly to run, in particular when they need to be carried out by specialists

-   Citizen science, i.e. the collection of ecological data by members of the public, has been growing rapidly and providing data at larger spatial and taxonomic scales than previously possible.

-   However, increased coverage and total sampling effort in citizen science monitoring often comes at the cost of data being presence-only and prone to bias, limiting usefulness in particular for the study of population dynamics and demography.

-   The exception are monitoring programmes that make use of a large number of citizen scientists that have been trained to collect data and record metadata in a structured manner and according to a carefully designed protocol (+ 1-2 internationally "widely known" programmes?)

-   Norway has one such monitoring programme that focuses on terrestrial gamebird species: Hønsefugltakseringen (needs an English name)

-   Brief intro of monitoring programme: sampling design (mention age- and sex- assigment), coverage, data handling, OA publishing of data

-   Brief intro of previously developed modelling framework: integrated distance sampling model using age-specific line transect data and auxiliary telemetry data to get estimates of population size and structure, as well as key vital rates (survival, recruitment), over time

-   Combined, national-scale monitoring and this modelling framework have potential for large-scale high-resolution modelling of population dynamics and its demographic and environmental drivers

-   In this study, we extended model of Nielsen & Nater 2023 to run not just on a single area but all areas with publicly available line transect data simultaneously

-   Capitalize on "sharing information" across locations and effectively space-for-time substitution to estimate population size, age-structure, survival, and recruitment across 41 reporting districts and 15 years (2007-2021) for willow ptarmigan

-   Shortly about willow ptarmigan (hereafter "ptarmigan"): sentinel species (sensitive to changes in climate and land-use), position in the foodweb (maybe? does it matter?), high cultural value (part of people's "nature experience", popular game species), not redlisted but popular hunting making sustainable management crucial

-   Wrap up with a sentence on why large-scale spatially explicit indicators for ptarmigan populations would be good to have (national and international context)?

# Methods

## Study species

-   Willow ptarmigan distribution, life history, and (historical) abundance

## Data collection, management, and preparation

### Line transect sampling

-   Setup of Hønsefugltakseringen monitoring programme (volunteer training, line transect sampling, spatio-temporal coverage, etc.)
-   Data & metadata recording via app
-   Quality control of data
-   Open access publishing of data (GBIF, LivingNorway)
-   Pre-modelling data wrangling

Distance-sampling data on willow ptarmigan is collected on line transects not only in western Lierne, but across most of its Norwegian range (https://honsefugl.nina.no/). Taking the line transect datasets from Fjellstyrene, Statskog, and FeFo together, there is data for willow ptarmigan in 41 reporting areas (for a list, see [here](https://github.com/ErlendNilsen/OpenPop_Integrated_DistSamp/blob/main/R/listAreas.R)).

### Radio-telemetry study in Lierne

-   Description of setup, data collection, temporal coverage, etc.
-   Pre-modelling data wrangling

## National-scale integrated model

### Integrated distance sampling model (IDSM) for willow ptarmigan

-   Introduction of integrated Distance sampling model (IDSM) from MS1

### Multi-area model extension

-   Addition of spatial dimension
-   Hyper-parameter distributions for spatial variation
-   Temporal variation (shared year RE and "residual" variation)

The model developed as part of this project and presented in @nilsen2023 was designed with the potential of extension to run on data from multiple areas simultaneously in mind, and this extension involves two steps in practice.

The first step is the inclusion of an additional dimension, area, to enable using data collected from multiple areas (@fig-model). The area-dimension is added across all model components with the exception of the known-fate telemetry data (and seasonal decomposition of survival estimated from it), as that is only available for the Lierne area.

The pink "x"'s indicate the added dimension for area. Juv\[x,t\] = juveniles in year t. Ad\[x,t\] = adults in year t. R\[x,t\] = recruitment rate in year t. S\[x,t\] = survival probability from year t to t+1.](Figures/RypeIDSM_multiArea_structure.png){#fig-model}

The second step is making adjustments to capitalize on the integration of data from multiple areas to make maximal use of available information. There are several not mutually exclusive options for approaching this, and one of them is the use of "hyper-parameters" for sharing information across areas [e.g. @horswill2019; @horswill2021]. As an illustrative example, take the area-specific average annual survival probability, $\mu^S_x$. Instead of assigning independent non-informative priors to each $\mu^S_x$, we now assume that the variation in average survival across space can be described by a common (logit) normal distribution such that:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu^S_x \sim Normal(logit(h.\mu^S), h.\sigma^S)
\end{equation}
$$ where $h.\mu^S$ is the "hyper mean" and $h.\sigma^S$ is the "hyper standard deviation". Non-informative priors are then assigned to the hyper-parameters instead of the area-specific realizations:

$$
\begin{align}
h.\mu^S & \sim Uniform(0,1) \\
h.\sigma^S & \sim Uniform(0, 5)
\end{align}
$$

For the multi-area implementation of the IDSM, we used the equivalent of the above approach for parameters representing average survival probabilities, baseline recruitment rates, rodent effect on recruitment, and average distance sampling detection. Initial population density, on the other hand, was estimated independently for each area. Random effects standard deviations were assumed to be the same for all areas, effectively resulting in space-for-time subtitution for random effect estimation.

Another approach to maximising information gain when jointly analysing data from different areas is explicit modelling of spatial and spatio-temporal variation.

## Reproducible workflow with "targets"

Reproducibility and ease of repeating analyses was a key focus when developing the multi-area IDSM.To that end, we set up the workflow as a "targets pipeline", implemented throught the R packages "targets" [@landau2021]. A visual representation of the pipeline is displayed in @fig-workflow.

# Results

## Population density

@fig-densA shows that population density is generally lowest in the Northern parts of Norway and highest in central Norway, close to the Swedish borders. Higher median density estimates also seem to be associated with higher estimation uncertainty (@fig-densB) and therefore have to be interpreted with care.

## Population growth rate

In most areas, populations of willow ptarmigan have been increasing over the period 2018-2020, potentially indicating a positive effect of more restricted hunting in recent years (@fig-lam). Some areas -- predominantly in central Norway -- also had declining populations, but many of those declines followed upon a period of increase between the start of data colection in 2007 and sometime between 2016 and 2018.

In b) darker colors indicate higher median values and higher uncertainty.

## Survival probability

Annual survival probabilities ranged from aroung 35% to 50% across reporting areas in Norway, with the highest values occurring in the far north and in the mountains in the south (@fig-pSurv).

:::

## Recruitment rate

Annual recruitment rates showed a spatial pattern (@fig-rRep) that was inverse relative to that of annual survival (@fig-pSurv), with lower recruitment rates co-occurring with higher survival rates and vice-versa. This is consistent with basic life history theory [@stearns1992] and with previous studies finding relatively slower life histories in alpine / high altitude areas [e.g. @sandercock2005; @bears2009; @alice2016].

## Effects of rodent occupancy

The model predicted substantial variation in the effect of the rodent occupancy covariate on recruitment (@fig-betaR). Areas in the north and south west generally had recruitment increasing with rodent occupancy while the remaining areas were a mosaic of positive and negative effects, albeit with some spatial clustering.

# Discussion

\[TBA\]

Another approach to maximising information gain when jointly analysing data from different areas is explicit modelling of spatial and spatio-temporal variation. While this is commonly done for modern species distribution models [e.g. @pacifici2017; @guelat2018], it has rarely been implemented in demographic models. This is not least due to the fact that few demographic models span large spatial extents. Since our IDSM and the willow ptarmigan data do actually do that though, extending the framework to account for spatial and spatiotemporal correlations may be feasible. Per now, we have not yet attempted this, but are planning to do so in the near future.
